# Non-Document Root Scrollers

A proposal to allow any scroller to become the *root scroller*. Today's web
endows the root element (i.e. the documentElement) with special powers (such
as hiding the URL bar). This proposal would give authors more flexibility in
structuring their apps by explaining where the documentElement's specialness
comes from and allowing the author to assign it to an arbitrary scroller. See
the
[explainer doc](https://github.com/bokand/NonBodyRootScroller/blob/master/explainer.md)
for a quick overview.
