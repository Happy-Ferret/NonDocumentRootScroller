# NonBodyRootScroller

A proposal to allow any scroller to become the *root scroller*. Today's web
endows the &lt;body> element with special powers (such as hiding the URL bar). This
proposal would give authors more flexibility in structuring their apps by
explaining where &lt;body>'s specialness comes from and allowing the author to
assign it to an arbitrary scroller. See the explainer doc for a quick overview.
